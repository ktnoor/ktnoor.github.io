## What is HMC?
Hierarchical Multi-label Classification (HMC) is a machine learning task that involves classifying instances into multiple labels that are organized in a hierarchical structure. Unlike traditional multi-label classification, where labels are independent, HMC takes into account the relationships between labels, which can be represented as a tree or a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This allows for more structured and meaningful predictions, especially in domains where labels have inherent hierarchies, such as image classification, text categorization, and bioinformatics.
