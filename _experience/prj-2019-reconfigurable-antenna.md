This project involved the design and development of advanced reconfigurable antenna systems capable of operating across multiple frequency bands. The work focused on implementing frequency-agile antenna solutions using electronic switching mechanisms for modern wireless communication applications.

The project required comprehensive understanding of antenna theory, electromagnetic modeling, and practical RF switch implementation. Multiple antenna topologies were explored including patch, dipole, and leaky-wave configurations to achieve optimal performance across target frequencies.

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- Designed versatile reconfigurable antenna systems (patch, dipole, leaky-wave configurations) operating at dual frequencies: 5GHz and 2.5GHz
- Implemented electronic frequency switching using Infineon BAT18-04 PIN diodes for seamless band reconfiguration
- Optimized antenna design for Rogers 5880 substrate (εr=2.2, h=1.6mm) with precise 50Ω impedance matching
- Performed comprehensive theoretical calculations for antenna dimensions and electromagnetic performance optimization
- Conducted detailed electromagnetic modeling and simulation using CST Studio Suite
- Validated antenna performance across both frequency bands with consideration for switching mechanism impact

**Software and Tools:**

- CST Studio Suite for electromagnetic simulation and antenna modeling

This project demonstrated expertise in advanced antenna design principles, reconfigurable RF systems, and electromagnetic simulation. The work contributed to understanding of frequency-agile antenna technologies essential for modern multi-band wireless communication systems and software-defined radio applications.
