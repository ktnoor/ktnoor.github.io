I worked as a sessional academic staff member at Deakin University, contributing to the Deep Learning (SIT319, SIT744) and Artificial and Computational Intelligence (SIT215) units. My responsibilities included conducting tutorials and workshops, as well as marking assignments. During the workshops, I:
- Designed, demonstrated, and explained deep learning models in Keras and TensorFlow as part of the workshop.
- Addressed student queries to enhance understanding and engagement.
- Provided academic consultation and contributed to the development of course materials.
