This project focused on the comprehensive design and implementation of digital logic circuits using CMOS technology. The work involved developing both universal and compound gates while mastering the fundamental principles of CMOS logic design and transistor-level implementation.

The project encompassed the complete design process from theoretical analysis to practical implementation, utilizing industry-standard VLSI design methodologies. Key emphasis was placed on understanding CMOS pull-up and pull-down tree logic structures and their optimization for performance and power efficiency.

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- Designed and implemented universal gates including NAND, XOR, and OAI22 configurations using CMOS logic
- Developed comprehensive stick diagram implementations for CMOS pull-up and pull-down tree structures
- Successfully implemented a carry ripple adder utilizing a full adder circuit with optimized transistor count (14 PMOS and 14 NMOS transistors)
- Gained proficiency in transistor-level circuit design and layout optimization
- Performed circuit simulation and verification using industry-standard tools

**Software and Tools:**
- Electric VLSI Design Software for layout and design
- LTSpice for circuit simulation and analysis

This project provided foundational knowledge in digital circuit design and VLSI implementation, establishing critical skills in transistor-level design, logic optimization, and electronic design automation tools essential for modern integrated circuit development.
