This collaborative project involved the design and implementation of a comprehensive Traffic Light Controller (TLC) system using FPGA technology. The project required advanced digital design skills, finite state machine implementation, and practical hardware interfacing for real-world traffic management applications.

Working in a multidisciplinary team environment, the project encompassed complete system development from initial design specification through final hardware demonstration. The implementation utilized advanced VHDL programming techniques and sophisticated display interfacing for user interaction.

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- Collaborated in team environment to develop complex Traffic Light Controller system with approximately 15 input/output interfaces
- Successfully implemented design on Xilinx Spartan3 XC3S200-FT256 development board with full hardware verification
- Demonstrated advanced proficiency in VHDL programming with working knowledge of Verilog HDL
- Implemented sophisticated sequential behavioral logic and finite state machine architectures for traffic control algorithms
- Conducted comprehensive RTL module analysis and optimized CLB (Configurable Logic Block) utilization
- Developed advanced 7-segment display interface (anode-based) to provide real-time countdown visualization for traffic signals
- Successfully demonstrated complete TLC system functionality with comprehensive technical documentation

**Software and Tools:**
- Xilinx ISE for FPGA development and synthesis
- VHDL for hardware description and system implementation

This project provided extensive experience in collaborative digital system design, advanced FPGA programming, and practical hardware implementation. The work demonstrated capability in complex state machine design, real-time system development, and professional project management in engineering team environments.
