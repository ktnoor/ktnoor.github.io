This project involved the complete design and implementation of a 68HC11-compatible microcontroller using hardware description languages. The work required comprehensive understanding of processor architecture, digital system design, and FPGA implementation methodologies.

The project encompassed the development of essential microcontroller components including bus architecture, register files, and multiple addressing modes. The design utilized both structural and behavioral modeling approaches to create a functional processor implementation.

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- Developed complete microcontroller architecture using VHDL in Xilinx development environment
- Implemented comprehensive dual-bus structure including dedicated address bus and data bus architectures
- Designed essential processor registers including program counter and accumulator with appropriate control logic
- Successfully implemented multiple addressing modes: inherent, relative, and extended addressing capabilities
- Created detailed block diagrams and system architecture documentation for complex digital system design
- Utilized both structural and sequential combination logic design methodologies for optimal implementation
- Demonstrated proficiency in digital system design from concept through FPGA implementation

**Software and Tools:**

- Xilinx ISE for FPGA development and synthesis
- VHDL for hardware description and system modeling

This project provided comprehensive experience in processor design, digital system architecture, and FPGA implementation. The work established foundational knowledge in computer architecture, hardware description languages, and embedded system design essential for modern digital system development.
