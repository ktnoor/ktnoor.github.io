This was a pioneering research project completed during my Master's degree that developed an innovative wearable ultraviolet light-detecting system with wireless communication capabilities. This project addressed the critical health challenge of balancing beneficial UV exposure for vitamin D synthesis while preventing harmful overexposure that can lead to skin damage and cancer.

The project involved comprehensive design and implementation of a real-time UV monitoring system that could wirelessly transmit ultraviolet intensity measurements to alert users before reaching dangerous exposure levels. The system represented a significant advancement in personal health monitoring technology, combining sensor engineering, wireless communications, and health safety applications.

Key Technical Achievements:

- Designed and implemented a comprehensive wearable UV sensing system
- Integrated wireless communication capabilities for real-time data transmission
- Developed algorithms to accurately detect and measure ultraviolet light intensity
- Created user alert mechanisms to prevent harmful overexposure
- Integrated the system for practical, everyday use

The innovation gained recognition through media coverage highlighting its potential as a world-first technology for personal UV protection. The project's significance was further acknowledged through coverage discussing its potential to [help users make informed decisions about sun exposure while maintaining the health benefits of appropriate UV light](https://lighthouse.mq.edu.au/article/july-2020/smart-uv-sensor-a-world-first-to-alert-users-to-over-exposure). Additional media attention highlighted the [wearable UV device's capability to ping users out of the sun](https://www.nssn.org.au/news/2020/7/7/wearable-uv-device-to-ping-users-out-of-the-sun) when exposure levels become dangerous.

This work contributed to the emerging field of wearable health monitoring devices and demonstrated practical applications of sensor technology in preventive healthcare, providing a foundation for consumer-grade UV protection systems that could help reduce skin cancer risks while preserving the essential health benefits of controlled sun exposure.
