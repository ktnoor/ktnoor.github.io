This advanced RF circuit design project involved the complete development of a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) system, from initial circuit design through final package implementation. The project addressed critical RF design challenges including noise optimization, impedance matching, and electromagnetic compatibility.

The design process required precise biasing of GaAs pHEMT transistor technology and comprehensive RF circuit analysis to meet stringent performance specifications. The project demonstrated expertise in high-frequency circuit design, electromagnetic simulation, and practical RF system implementation.

**Key Technical Achievements:**

- Developed complete LNA circuit achieving demanding specifications: 25 dB S21 gain, -10 dB S11 & S22 reflection coefficients, 1.3 dB noise figure, and 20 mA current consumption
- Successfully biased GaAs pHEMT 10Âµm transistor with optimized voltages for maximum gain across required bandwidth
- Designed sophisticated input/output matching circuits using Smith Chart analysis in AWR software
- Implemented comprehensive physical verification including DRC/DFM checks and parasitic extraction for high-quality layout delivery
- Performed detailed electromagnetic simulation and iterative circuit optimization to meet all specifications
- Developed complete package layout with bond wire modeling for 4x4 QFN package PCB implementation

**Software and Tools:**
- AWR Design Environment for RF circuit design and electromagnetic simulation

This project provided comprehensive experience in RF/microwave circuit design, demonstrating proficiency in advanced simulation tools, electromagnetic modeling, and practical considerations for high-frequency circuit implementation and packaging.
